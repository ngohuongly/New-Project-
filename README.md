# New-Project-
WE all know that automobile accidents cause a large number of fatalities in the World. in this project, we want to focus on Seattle. The data that I use in this project are colelcted from Seattle Police Department and Accident Traffic Records Department from 2004 to present. my goal is to predict the severity of the accident according to the weather conditions as well as road and light conditions. This study is very interesting and important for the target audience in order to make the right decisions to reduce the number of accidents. I also believe that this prediction will help the insurance company and police department to have more actions and prevention in order to control the number of accidents.
