# Business Introduction-

I want to introduce my new project this time about the analysis of restaurants business in Vietnam. The questions I want to ask are:
- If I want to open a new restaurant, which kind of restaurant should I target?
- Where should I place my restaurant? 
- Which kinds of customers should I think about? 
There are, indeed, more questions to write down when one wants to open a new restaurant but I just want to show you my analysis using FOURSQUARE APIs and the 2 cities that I chose are Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. I was born and raised in Vietnam and I am always curious to know how the most developped cities in my country will become. I hope that my project will be useful for you to have some new points of view if you are considering open a new business in one of those two cities.
